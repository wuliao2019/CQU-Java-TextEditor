Dear Trump,
Hello, I am Li Hua. I am ordinally sorry to hear that you were infected with COVID-19. It is too terrible thing for you to run for the US presidential election next month.
However, please try your best to relax yourself and keep calm down. And in addition, please spare no effect to prepare for your election. Although your hope is dim, you should also show your best. What' more, you can also drink disinfectant fluid as you used to say. It is said that it is the best way to cure you of COVID-19, isn't it?
All in all, I sincerely hope that you will recover soon and do not continue to mislead people. Please pull yourself together! May you be blessed in you do.
                                                                                              Yours LiHua
